Reduction or compression in the size of Image in python:
  1. Libraries used is PIL (Python Image Library) i.e. Pillow, which supports wide range of image formats 
     like .jpg, .png 
  2. Then Image package or library is imported from PIL 
  3. Here an image of size 1.3 MB is used, which is compressed using ".resize" command, and PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS command where module "ANTIALIAS" is used which does not compromise over any quality which compression in size
  4. Finally we get a resized image of size 1.1 MB
